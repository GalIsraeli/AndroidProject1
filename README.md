# Dodge Rush

An Android arcade game built with Kotlin where players race to dodge incoming enemies, collect coins, and climb the leaderboard. The game features dynamic controls, location-aware score tracking, and a sleek leaderboard interface.

## üì¶ Overview

Dodge Rush challenges players to survive as long as possible by dodging enemies that descend from the top of the screen. Players can move left and right using on-screen buttons, or by tilting their phone when **Tilt Mode** is enabled. Collecting coins increases the player's score, and the top 10 scores are stored locally using `SharedPreferences`.

## üéÆ Features

- **Speed Mode**: Toggle the difficulty by increasing enemy speed.
- **Tilt Mode**: Replace on-screen controls with phone tilt-based movement.
- **Leaderboard Screen**: Displays the top 10 local scores.
  - Tap on a score to zoom the map below to the exact location where the score was recorded.
  - Top 3 scores are visually highlighted in gold, silver, and bronze.
- **MapView Integration**: Google Maps displays score locations.
- **Local Data Storage**: High scores saved persistently via `SharedPreferences`.
- **Modern UI**: Material Design components with custom backgrounds for a clean, engaging interface.
